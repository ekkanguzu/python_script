# Given a list (vector), write a function "partial reversela, i, j*
# that will reverse the items in the array a starting
# at i and ending at j. Your choice whether to 0-index or 1-index 1 and j.
# For example, given the array equal- to (A, -B, C, D, E, F), and using an index starting at B:
# a = (A, B, C, D, E, F)
# partial_reverse(a, 2, 4)
# result: â€¢ (A, B, E, D, C, - F) #b-= [1, -2, 3, -4, 5, 6,-7]
# partial_reverse(b, 1, -4)
# result: . [1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 6]
